Revision history for Path-Tiny

{{$NEXT}}

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed child path construction against the root path.

    - Fixed path construction when a relative volume is provided as the
      first argument on Windows; e.g. path("C:", "lib") must be like
      path("C:lib"), not path("C:/lib").

    - On AIX, shared locking is replaced by exclusive locking on a R/W
      filehandle, as locking read handles is not supported

0.043     2013-10-14 06:24:06 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Calling 'absolute' on Windows will add the volume if it is missing
      (E.g. "/foo" will become "C:/foo").  This matches the behavior
      of File::Spec->rel2abs.

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed t/00-report-prereqs.t for use with older versions of
      CPAN::Meta::Requirements

0.042     2013-10-13 11:02:02 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - When 'realpath' can't be resolved (because intermediate directories
      don't exist), the exception now explains the error clearly instead of
      complaining about path() needing a defined, positive-length argument.

    - On Windows, fixed resolution of relative paths with a volume.
      E.g. "C:foo" is now correctly translated into getdcwd on "C:"
      plus "foo".

0.041     2013-10-11 08:56:31 America/New_York

    [FIXES]

    - Removes duplicate test dependency on File::Spec that triggers
      a CPAN.pm bug

0.040     2013-10-08 22:01:50 America/New_York

    [FIXES]

    - Fixed broken locking test on *bsd

    - When using 'filehandle' to request a locked handle that truncates an
      existing file and has a binmode starting with ":unix", this fixes a
      bug where pseudo-layers weren't being cleared properly.

0.039     2013-10-08 16:39:23 America/New_York

    [ADDITIONS]

    - The 'filehandle' method now offers an option to return locked handles
      based on the file mode.  Input-output methods now rely on this
      feature internally.  Truncating file modes defer truncation until
      after an exclusive lock is acquired.

    [FIXES]

    - The 'filehandle' method now respects default encoding set by
      the caller's open pragma.

0.038     2013-10-01 18:20:05 America/New_York

    [ADDITIONS]

    - Added 'is_rootdir' method to simplify testing if a path is
      the root directory

0.037     2013-09-25 13:00:25 America/New_York

    [FIXES]

    - Fixed for v5.8

0.036     2013-09-25 09:34:28 America/New_York

    [PREREQS]

    - No longer lists 'threads' as a prerequisite.  If you have a threaded
      perl, you have it and if you're not, Path::Tiny doesn't care.

0.035     2013-09-24 07:21:55 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed flock warning on BSD that was broken with the autodie
      removal; now also applies to all BSD flavors

0.034     2013-09-23 16:16:36 America/New_York

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

    - Exceptions are now Path::Tiny::Error objects, not autodie exceptions;
      this removes the last dependency on autodie, which allows us to
      support Perls as far back as v5.8.1

    [FIXED]

    - BSD/NFS flock fix was not backwards compatible before v5.14.  This
      fixes it harder.

    [PREREQS]

    - dropped autodie

    - lowered ExtUtils::MakeMaker configure_requires version to 6.17

0.033     2013-09-12 08:54:30 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Perl on BSD may not support locking on an NFS filesystem.  If this is
      detected, Path::Tiny warns and continues in an unsafe mode.  The
      'flock' warning category may be fatalized to die instead.

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Added 'iterator' example showing defaults

0.032     2013-09-06 17:52:48 America/New_York

    [PREREQS]

    - Removed several test dependencies.  Path::Tiny now only needs
      core modules, though some must be upgraded on old Perls

0.031     2013-08-27 10:03:57 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - parent() on paths with internal double dots (e.g. /foo..bar.txt) now works
      correctly

0.030     2013-08-20 16:10:04 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - t/zzz-spec.t used getcwd() instead of getdcwd(), which breaks
      on Windows if the build directory isn't on the 'C' drive

0.029     2013-08-19 11:52:24 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - On Win32, "C:/" no longer is changed to "C:".  Also, "C:" is
      converted to the absolute path of cwd on the "C:" volume.  UNC paths
      ("//server/share/") now retain their trailing slash to correctly
      distinguish volume and directory paths when split

0.028     2013-08-14 13:12:49 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - The 'children()' method now takes an optional regular expression to
      filter the results

0.027     2013-07-25 19:38:44 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added the 'digest' method to produce a hexadecimal SHA-256
      (or user-specified) digest of a file

0.026     2013-07-14 21:25:22 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed bug where lines() with a count longer than the
      file would return undef for the extra lines.  Now returns
      only the lines in the file if the count is greater than
      the number of lines.

0.025     2013-07-10 09:32:13 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Spew to an existing symlink now atomically replaces
      the resolved destination, not the symlink

0.024     2013-06-17 18:12:36 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Win32 pseudo-forks don't load threads.pm, so we do that
      in CLONE to ensure we get the thread ID

0.023     2013-06-12 07:18:31 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Removing dangling symlinks now works

0.022     2013-05-28 11:57:15 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - The 'touch' method can now take an epoch secs argument

0.021     2013-05-17 22:53:18 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed fatal bug with lines_utf8 using chomp

    [DOCS]

    - Pod typos fixed

0.020     2013-04-13 06:58:11 Europe/London

    [FIXED]

    - More descriptive error message if copy() fails

0.019     2013-04-12 06:58:18 Europe/London

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed warning about -l on dirhandle in iterator()

0.018     2013-04-08 12:44:31 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - cwd, rootdir, tempfile and tempdir can now be exported on request
      and used as functions instead of as methods

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed regression in lines() where it no longer returned count
      of lines in scalar context

0.017     2013-03-28 16:49:15 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - path() constructor now glob-expands tildes (~)

    [CHANGED]

    - Improved options validation; invalid options now throw errors

0.016     2013-03-26 14:59:36 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - The iterator now has an optional recursive mode

    [CHANGED]

    - We no longer use autodie directly, but we throw our
      own autodie::exceptions on error.  This avoids the overhead
      of wrapping built-ins with function calls.

    - Most dependencies are now loaded on demand, reducing startup
      time.

0.015     2013-03-13 13:20:38 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - touch and touchpath now return the object to allow easy chaining
      with spew

0.014     2013-03-09 08:54:26 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - parent now takes an optional argument to look upwards multiple
      times in one call.  e.g. $path->parent(2)

0.013     2013-02-22 10:58:05 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - remove_tree now defaults to safe mode and will not attempt to chmod
      and remove directories with insufficient permissions

    - Temporary files and directories are always created with an
      absolute path.

    [FIXED]

    - Failures from autodie are reported from our caller's location
      (as if we called croak()); bumped autodie prereq to 2.14 for
      this feature

    - Failures from mkpath and remove_tree are now trapped and
      thrown as exceptions.  (Making an existing path or removing
      a non-existant path return false and are not errors);

0.012     2013-02-20 09:34:50 America/New_York

    [REMOVED]

    - The 'remove' function no longer works on directories.  The new
      'remove_tree' method should be used instead.

    [CHANGED]

    - path() now requires a defined, positive-length argument to keep you
      safe from subtle bugs in your code that pass an undef or empty
      argument to path suddenly having you operating in the current
      directory.

    [ADDED]

    - Added Path::Tiny->cwd as a constructor to give an absolute
      path to the current working directory

    - Added 'remove_tree' as a method for recursively removing
      a directory

0.011     2013-02-19 11:08:44 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - slurp/spew/etc and openr/openw/etc now repect default layers
      set by -C or the open pragma

    - spew and append can now be given array references to output
      to avoid extra copying

0.010     2013-02-16 10:26:38 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - The 'tempdir' and 'tempfile' methods can now both take either leading
      templates or a TEMPLATE option, so you don't have to remember which
      one File::Temp wants

0.009     2013-02-15 16:05:39 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Dropped use of '//' to allow Path::Tiny to run on Perl 5.008

0.008     2013-02-15 13:49:54 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'touchpath' method combining 'mkpath' and 'touch'

0.007     2013-02-12 17:41:44 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Unicode::UTF8 0.58 is necessary for optional faster
      Unicode processing

0.006     2013-02-11 13:22:18 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - t/parent.t is amended to work on Windows

    - new() now correctly takes multiple path arguments, like path()

0.005     2013-02-07 15:41:32 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed test for platforms with /sbin symlinked to /usr/sbin

0.004     2013-02-05 19:19:46 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added slurp_raw and other *_raw helper methods

    - Added realpath method (with thanks to ether)

    - Added canonpath method (with thanks to sjmiller)

    [FIXED]

    - slurp/lines/spew/append now do appropriate flocking

    - Fixed test that fails if run as root (bingos)

    - Fixed test that fails if cwd/getcwd don't agree

    [CHANGED]

    - internal optimizations

0.003     2013-01-31 06:59:50 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - lstat was calling the wrong stat [rt.cpan.org #83063]

    - make atomic writes thread-safe [rt.cpan.org #83064]

    [CHANGED]

    - updated bugtracker to point to github

0.002     2013-01-30 22:09:37 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - s/File::Stat/File::stat/; # OMG! I hate case insensitivity
