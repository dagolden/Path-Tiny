Revision history for Path-Tiny

{{$NEXT}}

    [Additions]
    
    - Added 'process' method to execute a callback for each line of a
      file without really editing it.

0.104     2017-02-17 07:17:00-05:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.103-TRIAL.

0.103     2017-02-10 17:25:06-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Bug fixes]

    - Path::Tiny 0.101 on Windows made `$path->absolute("/foo")` return an
      absolute path starting with 'C:/foo', which was an unintentional
      behavior change.  This release now uses any absolute base without
      further normalization.

0.101     2017-02-05 09:56:46-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Changes]

    - The 'absolute' method now always returns an absolute path, even if a
      user provided a relative path for the base path.  The old, odd
      behavior was documented, but people often don't read docs.  The new
      behavior avoids suprises.

    [Additions]

    - Added 'cached_temp' method.

0.100     2017-01-14 22:47:55-05:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.099-TRIAL.

0.099     2017-01-10 15:12:13-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Tests]

    - Fixed tests for eventual removal of '.' from `@INC` in Perl.

    [Documentation]

    - Fixed filehandle mode typo.

    - Fixed typo in relative() that mentioned rel2abs instead of abs2rel.

0.098     2016-10-09 23:25:11-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.097-TRIAL.

0.097     2016-09-30 22:03:10-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Additions]

    - Added 'realpath' option for 'tempfile' and 'tempdir' for situations
      where an absolute temporary path just isn't enough.

0.096     2016-07-02 21:25:33-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.095

0.095     2016-06-28 12:05:03-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Tests]

    - Improved method for hiding some modules during tests.

0.094     2016-05-23 12:45:19-04:00 America/New_York

    - Fixed Changes note typo in 0.092.  0.092 had no changes since 0.091,
      not 0.090, meaning that all 0.091 changes were (and are) included.

0.092     2016-05-23 11:36:54-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.091

0.091     2016-05-17 13:32:21-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Changes]

    - Path::Tiny will prefer PerlIO::utf8_strict over encoding(UTF-8)
      if available and Unicode::UTF8 is not installed.

    [Fixes]

    - The 'touch' method can now set the current time on files that aren't
      owned, as long as they are writeable.

    [Tests]

    - Improved consistency of symlink support inspection; now always
      looks at $Config{d_symlink}.

    - Skips impossible test on 'msys' platform.

0.090     2016-05-02 07:08:58-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.089

0.089     2016-04-26 22:21:00-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Fixes]

    - Fix spew_utf8 to allow array references as input.

0.088     2016-04-15 08:41:07-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.087

0.087     2016-04-12 12:13:14-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Fixes]

    - Fixed bugs in relative symlink resolution for realpath, spew and
      edit_lines.

    [Changes]

    - Symlink resolution will detect circular loops and throw an error.

0.086     2016-04-03 13:49:37-04:00 America/New_York

    [Documented]

    - Improved documentation of copy and move.

0.084     2016-03-04 07:17:49-05:00 America/New_York

    [Fixes]

    - Fixed relative() for the case with regex metacharacters in the path

0.082     2016-03-01 18:23:26-05:00 America/New_York

    [!!! INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES !!!]

    - (This warning repeated from 0.079-TRIAL) The relative() method no
      longer uses File::Spec's buggy abs2rel method.  The new Path::Tiny
      algorithm should be comparable and passes File::Spec abs2rel test
      cases, except that it correctly accounts for symlinks.  For common
      use, you are not likely to notice any difference. For uncommon use,
      this should be an improvement.  As a side benefit, this change drops
      the minimum File::Spec version required, allowing Path::Tiny to be
      fatpacked if desired.

    [Changes]

    - no other changes from 0.081

0.081     2016-02-18 16:55:37-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed lines_utf8+chomp and relative() bugs on Windows

0.079     2016-02-15 20:52:10-07:00 America/Mazatlan (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [!!! INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES !!!]

    - The relative() method no longer uses File::Spec's buggy rel2bs
      method.  The new Path::Tiny algorithm should be comparable and passes
      File::Spec abs2rel test cases, except that it correctly accounts for
      symlinks.  For common use, you are not likely to notice any
      difference. For uncommon use, this should be an improvement.  As a
      side benefit, this change drops the minimum File::Spec version
      required, allowing Path::Tiny to be fatpacked if desired.

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed lines_utf8() with chomping for repeated empty lines.

    [DOCS]

    - Documented that subclassing is not supported

0.077     2016-02-10 14:17:32-07:00 America/Mazatlan (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'edit' and 'edit_lines' plus _utf8 and _raw variants; this
      is similar to perl's -i flag (though without backups)

0.076     2015-11-16 10:47:24-05:00 America/New_York

    - no changes from 0.075

0.075     2015-11-15 21:02:18-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [FIXED]

    - Tilde expansion on Windows was resulting in backslashes.  Now they
      are correctly normalized to forward slashes.

    [DOCS]

    - Typos fixed

0.073     2015-10-30 10:36:18-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed spewing to a symlink that crosses a filesystem boundary

    [PREREQS]

    - Add Test::MockRandom to META as an recommended test prerequisite.

0.072     2015-07-20 16:07:20-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.071

0.071     2015-07-17 13:40:08-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed incorrect error argument for File::Path functions
      (mkpath and remove_tree)

0.070     2015-06-28 13:50:16-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.069

0.069     2015-06-18 18:09:44-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [CHANGED]

    - The 'copy' method now returns the object for the copied file

    [FIXED]

    - The 'visit' method only dereferences the callback return value
      for scalar refs, avoiding some common bugs

0.068     2015-03-23 20:42:56-04:00 America/New_York

    [META]

    - Jumping to 0.068 to get to an even-version for a stable release

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Noted that 0.66 changed the 'filehandle' method

0.066     2015-03-20 23:59:08-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [ADDED]

    - Added exclusive locking option to filehandle opens; spew now
      exclusively locks tempfile used for atomic writes

0.065     2015-03-06 05:59:56-05:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'assert' method

    - Added 'visit' method

    - Added support for a negative count for 'lines' to get the
      last lines of a file

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed tilde expansion if path has spaces

    - Make realpath non-fatal if the parent path exists and only the final
      path component does not. (Was fatal on Windows and some Unixes.)

    - Removed rendundant locking on tempfile use for spewing

    - Work around File::Temp bugs on older ActiveState Windows Perls
      https://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=104767 

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Fixed SYNOPSIS example

0.064     2015-03-05 03:58:42-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

0.063     2015-03-04 16:00:17-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

0.062     2015-03-04 13:59:31-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

0.061     2014-11-13 16:50:05-05:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed append_utf8 and append_raw with 'truncate' option.

0.060     2014-11-04 17:33:39-05:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'truncate' option to append for in-place replacement of
      file contents.

0.059     2014-10-14 12:45:46-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed precedence bug in the check for Unicode::UTF8

0.058     2014-09-23 11:00:24-04:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added a 'sibling' method as a more efficient form of
      calling $path->parent->child(...).

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Every method annotated with the version number of the
      last API change.

0.057     2014-09-19 11:23:05-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - On AIX, reads that default to locking would fail without
      write permissions, because locking needs write permissions.
      The fix is only to lock reads if write permissions exist;
      otherwise locking is skipped.

0.056     2014-08-07 15:08:41-04:00 America/New_York

    [*** DEPRECATIONS ***]

    - The 'dirname' method is deprecated due to exposing File::Spec
      inconsistencies

    [ADDED]

    - The 'digest' method now takes a 'chunk_size' option to avoid
      slurping files entirely into memory.

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed problem throwing errors from 'remove'

0.055     2014-06-30 10:29:28-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - tempfile/tempdir won't warn if used as functions without arguments

0.054     2014-05-04 13:56:11-04:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - The 'basename' method now takes a list of suffixes to remove before
      returning the name

    - FREEZE/THAW/TO_JSON serialization helpers

    [CHANGED]

    - When constructing a Path::Tiny object from another, the original
      is returned unless it's a temp dir/file.  This significantly
      speeds up calling path($path) if $path is already a Path::Tiny
      object. (Thanks to Michael Schwern for prompting such benchmarking.)

    [FIXED]

    - Constructing any path -- e.g. with child() -- with undef or
      zero-length parts throws an error instead of constructing an
      invalid path

0.053     2014-03-24 09:25:51-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - The 'is_file' method now does -e && ! -d and not -f because -f
      is often more restrictive than people intend or expect.

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'chmod' method with symbolic chmod support ("a=r,u+rx")

0.052     2014-01-14 15:58:03-05:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Backslash-to-slash conversion now only happens on Windows
      (since backslash is legal on Unix, we must allow it)

0.051     2013-12-20 07:34:14 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed file order bug in the new test file

0.050     2013-12-20 07:27:20 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Recursive iteration won't throw an exception if a directory is
      removed or unreadable during iteration.

0.049     2013-12-12 00:48:01 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Generates filename for atomic writes independent of thread-ID.
      Fixes crashing bug on Win32 when fork() is called.

0.048     2013-12-11 21:56:23 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'subsumes' method

    [CHANGED]

    - The 'chomp' option for 'lines' will remove any end-of-line sequences
      fully instead of just chomping the last character

    - The 'flock' package will no longer indexed by PAUSE

    [FIXED]

    - Hides warnings and fixes possible fatal errors from pure-perl Cwd,
      particularly on MSWin32

0.047     2013-11-26 15:11:13 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Previous lock testing fixes broke on Windows (sigh); now fixed,
      I hope.

0.046     2013-11-22 17:07:24 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Revised locking tests for portability again: locks are now tested
      from a separate process

0.045     2013-11-22 15:28:50 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed locking test on AIX

0.044     2013-10-17 17:00:41 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed child path construction against the root path.

    - Fixed path construction when a relative volume is provided as the
      first argument on Windows; e.g. path("C:", "lib") must be like
      path("C:lib"), not path("C:/lib").

    - On AIX, shared locking is replaced by exclusive locking on a R/W
      filehandle, as locking read handles is not supported

0.043     2013-10-14 06:24:06 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Calling 'absolute' on Windows will add the volume if it is missing
      (E.g. "/foo" will become "C:/foo").  This matches the behavior
      of File::Spec->rel2abs.

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed t/00-report-prereqs.t for use with older versions of
      CPAN::Meta::Requirements

0.042     2013-10-13 11:02:02 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - When 'realpath' can't be resolved (because intermediate directories
      don't exist), the exception now explains the error clearly instead of
      complaining about path() needing a defined, positive-length argument.

    - On Windows, fixed resolution of relative paths with a volume.
      E.g. "C:foo" is now correctly translated into getdcwd on "C:"
      plus "foo".

0.041     2013-10-11 08:56:31 America/New_York

    [FIXES]

    - Removes duplicate test dependency on File::Spec that triggers
      a CPAN.pm bug

0.040     2013-10-08 22:01:50 America/New_York

    [FIXES]

    - Fixed broken locking test on *bsd

    - When using 'filehandle' to request a locked handle that truncates an
      existing file and has a binmode starting with ":unix", this fixes a
      bug where pseudo-layers weren't being cleared properly.

0.039     2013-10-08 16:39:23 America/New_York

    [ADDITIONS]

    - The 'filehandle' method now offers an option to return locked handles
      based on the file mode.  Input-output methods now rely on this
      feature internally.  Truncating file modes defer truncation until
      after an exclusive lock is acquired.

    [FIXES]

    - The 'filehandle' method now respects default encoding set by
      the caller's open pragma.

0.038     2013-10-01 18:20:05 America/New_York

    [ADDITIONS]

    - Added 'is_rootdir' method to simplify testing if a path is
      the root directory

0.037     2013-09-25 13:00:25 America/New_York

    [FIXES]

    - Fixed for v5.8

0.036     2013-09-25 09:34:28 America/New_York

    [PREREQS]

    - No longer lists 'threads' as a prerequisite.  If you have a threaded
      perl, you have it and if you're not, Path::Tiny doesn't care.

0.035     2013-09-24 07:21:55 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed flock warning on BSD that was broken with the autodie
      removal; now also applies to all BSD flavors

0.034     2013-09-23 16:16:36 America/New_York

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

    - Exceptions are now Path::Tiny::Error objects, not autodie exceptions;
      this removes the last dependency on autodie, which allows us to
      support Perls as far back as v5.8.1

    [FIXED]

    - BSD/NFS flock fix was not backwards compatible before v5.14.  This
      fixes it harder.

    [PREREQS]

    - dropped autodie

    - lowered ExtUtils::MakeMaker configure_requires version to 6.17

0.033     2013-09-12 08:54:30 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Perl on BSD may not support locking on an NFS filesystem.  If this is
      detected, Path::Tiny warns and continues in an unsafe mode.  The
      'flock' warning category may be fatalized to die instead.

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Added 'iterator' example showing defaults

0.032     2013-09-06 17:52:48 America/New_York

    [PREREQS]

    - Removed several test dependencies.  Path::Tiny now only needs
      core modules, though some must be upgraded on old Perls

0.031     2013-08-27 10:03:57 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - parent() on paths with internal double dots (e.g. /foo..bar.txt) now works
      correctly

0.030     2013-08-20 16:10:04 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - t/zzz-spec.t used getcwd() instead of getdcwd(), which breaks
      on Windows if the build directory isn't on the 'C' drive

0.029     2013-08-19 11:52:24 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - On Win32, "C:/" no longer is changed to "C:".  Also, "C:" is
      converted to the absolute path of cwd on the "C:" volume.  UNC paths
      ("//server/share/") now retain their trailing slash to correctly
      distinguish volume and directory paths when split

0.028     2013-08-14 13:12:49 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - The 'children()' method now takes an optional regular expression to
      filter the results

0.027     2013-07-25 19:38:44 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added the 'digest' method to produce a hexadecimal SHA-256
      (or user-specified) digest of a file

0.026     2013-07-14 21:25:22 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed bug where lines() with a count longer than the
      file would return undef for the extra lines.  Now returns
      only the lines in the file if the count is greater than
      the number of lines.

0.025     2013-07-10 09:32:13 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Spew to an existing symlink now atomically replaces
      the resolved destination, not the symlink

0.024     2013-06-17 18:12:36 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Win32 pseudo-forks don't load threads.pm, so we do that
      in CLONE to ensure we get the thread ID

0.023     2013-06-12 07:18:31 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Removing dangling symlinks now works

0.022     2013-05-28 11:57:15 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - The 'touch' method can now take an epoch secs argument

0.021     2013-05-17 22:53:18 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed fatal bug with lines_utf8 using chomp

    [DOCS]

    - Pod typos fixed

0.020     2013-04-13 06:58:11 Europe/London

    [FIXED]

    - More descriptive error message if copy() fails

0.019     2013-04-12 06:58:18 Europe/London

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed warning about -l on dirhandle in iterator()

0.018     2013-04-08 12:44:31 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - cwd, rootdir, tempfile and tempdir can now be exported on request
      and used as functions instead of as methods

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed regression in lines() where it no longer returned count
      of lines in scalar context

0.017     2013-03-28 16:49:15 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - path() constructor now glob-expands tildes (~)

    [CHANGED]

    - Improved options validation; invalid options now throw errors

0.016     2013-03-26 14:59:36 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - The iterator now has an optional recursive mode

    [CHANGED]

    - We no longer use autodie directly, but we throw our
      own autodie::exceptions on error.  This avoids the overhead
      of wrapping built-ins with function calls.

    - Most dependencies are now loaded on demand, reducing startup
      time.

    [CHANGED]

    - touch and touchpath now return the object to allow easy chaining
      with spew

    [ADDED]

    - parent now takes an optional argument to look upwards multiple
      times in one call.  e.g. $path->parent(2)

    [CHANGED]

    - remove_tree now defaults to safe mode and will not attempt to chmod
      and remove directories with insufficient permissions

    - Temporary files and directories are always created with an
      absolute path.

    [FIXED]

    - Failures from autodie are reported from our caller's location
      (as if we called croak()); bumped autodie prereq to 2.14 for
      this feature

    - Failures from mkpath and remove_tree are now trapped and
      thrown as exceptions.  (Making an existing path or removing
      a non-existant path return false and are not errors);

    [REMOVED]

    - The 'remove' function no longer works on directories.  The new
      'remove_tree' method should be used instead.

    [CHANGED]

    - path() now requires a defined, positive-length argument to keep you
      safe from subtle bugs in your code that pass an undef or empty
      argument to path suddenly having you operating in the current
      directory.

    [ADDED]

    - Added Path::Tiny->cwd as a constructor to give an absolute
      path to the current working directory

    - Added 'remove_tree' as a method for recursively removing
      a directory

    [CHANGED]

    - slurp/spew/etc and openr/openw/etc now repect default layers
      set by -C or the open pragma

    - spew and append can now be given array references to output
      to avoid extra copying

0.010     2013-02-16 10:26:38 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - The 'tempdir' and 'tempfile' methods can now both take either leading
      templates or a TEMPLATE option, so you don't have to remember which
      one File::Temp wants

    [CHANGED]

    - Dropped use of '//' to allow Path::Tiny to run on Perl 5.008

    [FIXED]

    - t/parent.t is amended to work on Windows

    - new() now correctly takes multiple path arguments, like path()

    - Added slurp_raw and other *_raw helper methods

    - Added realpath method (with thanks to ether)

    - Added canonpath method (with thanks to sjmiller)

    [FIXED]

    - slurp/lines/spew/append now do appropriate flocking

    - Fixed test that fails if run as root (bingos)

    - Fixed test that fails if cwd/getcwd don't agree

    [CHANGED]

    - internal optimizations

0.003     2013-01-31 06:59:50 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - lstat was calling the wrong stat [rt.cpan.org #83063]
