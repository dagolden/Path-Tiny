0.020     2013-04-13 06:58:11 Europe/London

    [FIXED]

0.019     2013-04-12 06:58:18 Europe/London

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed warning about -l on dirhandle in iterator()

0.018     2013-04-08 12:44:31 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - cwd, rootdir, tempfile and tempdir can now be exported on request
      and used as functions instead of as methods

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed regression in lines() where it no longer returned count
      of lines in scalar context

0.017     2013-03-28 16:49:15 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - path() constructor now glob-expands tildes (~)

    [CHANGED]

    - Improved options validation; invalid options now throw errors

0.016     2013-03-26 14:59:36 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - The iterator now has an optional recursive mode

    [CHANGED]

    - We no longer use autodie directly, but we throw our
      own autodie::exceptions on error.  This avoids the overhead
      of wrapping built-ins with function calls.

    - Most dependencies are now loaded on demand, reducing startup
      time.

0.015     2013-03-13 13:20:38 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - touch and touchpath now return the object to allow easy chaining
      with spew

0.014     2013-03-09 08:54:26 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - parent now takes an optional argument to look upwards multiple
      times in one call.  e.g. $path->parent(2)

0.013     2013-02-22 10:58:05 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - remove_tree now defaults to safe mode and will not attempt to chmod
      and remove directories with insufficient permissions

    - Temporary files and directories are always created with an
      absolute path.

    [FIXED]

    - Failures from autodie are reported from our caller's location
      (as if we called croak()); bumped autodie prereq to 2.14 for
      this feature

    - Failures from mkpath and remove_tree are now trapped and
      thrown as exceptions.  (Making an existing path or removing
      a non-existant path return false and are not errors);

0.012     2013-02-20 09:34:50 America/New_York

    [REMOVED]

    - The 'remove' function no longer works on directories.  The new
      'remove_tree' method should be used instead.

    [CHANGED]

    - path() now requires a defined, positive-length argument to keep you
      safe from subtle bugs in your code that pass an undef or empty
      argument to path suddenly having you operating in the current
      directory.

    [ADDED]

    - Added Path::Tiny->cwd as a constructor to give an absolute
      path to the current working directory

    - Added 'remove_tree' as a method for recursively removing
      a directory

0.011     2013-02-19 11:08:44 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - slurp/spew/etc and openr/openw/etc now repect default layers
      set by -C or the open pragma

    - spew and append can now be given array references to output
      to avoid extra copying

0.010     2013-02-16 10:26:38 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - The 'tempdir' and 'tempfile' methods can now both take either leading
      templates or a TEMPLATE option, so you don't have to remember which
      one File::Temp wants

0.009     2013-02-15 16:05:39 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Dropped use of '//' to allow Path::Tiny to run on Perl 5.008

0.008     2013-02-15 13:49:54 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'touchpath' method combining 'mkpath' and 'touch'

0.007     2013-02-12 17:41:44 America/New_York

      Unicode processing

    - Added realpath method (with thanks to ether)

    - Added canonpath method (with thanks to sjmiller)

    [FIXED]

    - slurp/lines/spew/append now do appropriate flocking

    - Fixed test that fails if run as root (bingos)

    - Fixed test that fails if cwd/getcwd don't agree

    [CHANGED]

    - internal optimizations

0.003     2013-01-31 06:59:50 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - lstat was calling the wrong stat [rt.cpan.org #83063]

    - make atomic writes thread-safe [rt.cpan.org #83064]

    [CHANGED]

    - updated bugtracker to point to github

0.002     2013-01-30 22:09:37 America/New_York
