=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module attempts to provide a small, fast utility for working with
file paths.  It is friendlier to use than L<File::Spec> and provides
easy access to functions from several other core file handling modules.

It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as L<IO::All> or L<Path::Class>,
nor does it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32 platforms.
Even then, it might break if you try something particularly obscure or
tortuous.  (Quick!  What does this mean: C<< ///../../..//./././a//b/.././c/././ >>?
And how does it differ on Win32?)

All paths are forced to have Unix-style forward slashes.  Stringifying
the object gives you back the path (after some clean up).

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 path

    $path = path("foo/bar");
    $path = path("/tmp/file.txt");
    $path = path(); # like path(".")

Constructs a C<Path::Tiny> object.  It doesn't matter if you give a file or
directory path.  It's still up to you to call directory-like methods only on
directories and file-like methods only on files.  This function is exported
automatically by default.

=head2 new

    $path = Path::Tiny->new("foo/bar");

This is just like C<path>, but with method call overhead.  (Why would you
do that?)

=head2 rootdir

    $path = Path::Tiny->rootdir; # /

Gives you C<< File::Spec->rootdir >> as a C<Path::Tiny> object if you're too
picky for C<path("/")>.

=head2 tempfile

    $temp = Path::Tiny->tempfile( @options );

This passes the options to C<< File::Temp->new >> and returns a C<Path::Tiny>
object with the file name.  If you want a template, you must use a C<TEMPLATE>
named argument.  The C<TMPDIR> option is enabled by default.

The resulting C<File::Temp> object is cached. When the C<Path::Tiny> object is
destroyed, the C<File::Temp> object will be as well.

=head2 tempdir

    $temp = Path::Tiny->tempdir( @options );

This is just like C<tempfile>, except it calls C<< File::Temp->newdir >> instead.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 absolute

    $abs = path("foo/bar")->absolute;
    $abs = path("foo/bar")->absolute("/tmp");

Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object with an absolute path.  Unless
an argument is given, the current directory is used as the absolute base path.
The argument must be absolute or you won't get an absolute result.

=head2 append

    path("foo.txt")->append(@data);
    path("foo.txt")->append({binmode => ":raw"}, @data);

Appends data to a file.  The file is locked with C<flock> prior to writing.  An
optional hash reference may be used to pass options.  The only option is
C<binmode>, which is passed to C<binmode()> on the handle used for writing.

=head2 append_utf8

    path("foo.txt")->append_utf8(@data);

This is like C<append> with a C<binmode> of C<:encoding(UTF-8)>.

=head2 basename

    $name = path("foo/bar.txt")->basename; # bar.txt

Returns the file portion or last directory portion of a path.

=head2 child

    $file = path("/tmp")->child("foo.txt"); # "/tmp/foo.txt"
    $file = path("/tmp")->child(@parts);

Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object relative to the original.  Works
like C<catfile> or C<catdir> from File::Spec, but without caring about
file or directories.

=head2 children

    @paths = path("/tmp")->children;

Returns a list of C<Path::Tiny> objects for all file and directories
within a directory.  Excludes "." and ".." automatically.

=head2 copy

    path("/tmp/foo.txt")->copy("/tmp/bar.txt");

Copies a file using L<File::Copy>'s C<copy> function.

=head2 dirname

    $name = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->dirname; # "/tmp/"

Returns the directory name portion of the path.  This is roughly
equivalent to what L<File::Spec> would give from C<splitpath> and thus
usually has the trailing slash. If that's not desired, stringify directories
or call C<parent> on files.

=head2 exists

    if ( path("/tmp")->exists ) { ... }

Just like C<-e>.

=head2 filehandle

    $fh = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->filehandle($mode, $binmode);

Returns an open file handle.  The C<$mode> argument must be a Perl-style
read/write mode string ("<" ,">", "<<", etc.).  If a C<$binmode>
is given, it is passed to C<binmode> on the handle.

See C<openr>, C<openw>, C<openrw>, and C<opena> for sugar.

=head2 is_absolute

    if ( path("/tmp")->is_absolute ) { ... }

Boolean for whether the path appears absolute or not.

=head2 is_dir

    if ( path("/tmp")->is_dir ) { ... }

Just like C<-d>.  This means it actually has to exist on the filesystem.
Until then, it's just a path.

=head2 is_file

    if ( path("/tmp")->is_file ) { ... }

Just like C<-f>.  This means it actually has to exist on the filesystem.
Until then, it's just a path.

=head2 is_relative

    if ( path("/tmp")->is_relative ) { ... }

Boolean for whether the path appears relative or not.

=head2 iterator

    $iter = path("/tmp")->iterator;
    while ( $path = $iter->() ) {
        ...
    }

Returns a code reference that walks a directory lazily.  Each invocation
returns a C<Path::Tiny> object or undef when the iterator is exhausted.

This iterator is B<not> recursive.  For recursive iteration, use
L<Path::Iterator::Rule> instead.

=head2 lines

    @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines;
    @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines(\%options);

Returns a list of lines from a file.  Optionally takes a hash-reference of
options.  Valid options are C<binmode>, C<count> and C<chomp>.  If C<binmode>
is provided, it will be set on the handle prior to reading.  If C<count> is
provided, up to that many lines will be returned. If C<chomp> is set, lines
will be chomped before being returned.

=head2 lines_utf8

    @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines_utf8;
    @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines({chomp => 1});

This is like C<lines> with a C<binmode> of C<:encoding(UTF-8)>.

=head2 lstat

    $stat = path("/some/symlink")->lstat;

Like calling C<lstat> from L<File::stat>.

=head2 mkpath

    path("foo/bar/baz")->mkpath;
    path("foo/bar/baz")->mkpath( \%options );

Like calling C<make_path> from L<File::Path>.  An optional hash reference
is passed through to C<make_path>.

=head2 move

    path("foo.txt")->move("bar.txt");

Just like C<rename>.

=head2 openr, openw, openrw, opena

    $fh = path("foo.txt")->openr($binmode);  # read
    $fh = path("foo.txt")->openr_utf8;

    $fh = path("foo.txt")->openw($binmode);  # write
    $fh = path("foo.txt")->openw_utf8;

    $fh = path("foo.txt")->opena($binmode);  # append
    $fh = path("foo.txt")->opena_utf8;

    $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw($binmode); # read/write
    $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw_utf8;

Returns a file handle opened in the specified mode.  The C<openr> style
methods take a single C<binmode> argument.  All of the C<open*> methods have
C<open*_utf8> equivalents that use C<:encoding(UTF-8)>.

=head2 parent

    $parent = path("foo/bar/baz")->parent; # foo/bar
    $parent = path("foo/wibble.txt")->parent; # foo

Returns a C<Path::Tiny> object corresponding to the parent
directory of the original directory or file.

=head2 relative

    $rel = path("/tmp/foo/bar")->relative("/tmp"); # foo/bar

Returns a C<Path::Tiny> object with a relative path name.
Given the trickiness of this, it's a thin wrapper around
C<< File::Spec->abs2rel() >>.

=head2 remove

    # directory
    path("foo/bar/baz")->remove;
    path("foo/bar/baz")->remove( \%options );

    # file
    path("foo.txt")->remove;

For directories, this is like like calling C<remove_tree> from L<File::Path>.  An
optional hash reference is passed through to C<remove_tree>.

For files, the file is unlinked if it exists.  Unlike C<unlink>, if the file
does not exist, this silently does nothing and returns a true value anyway.

=head2 slurp

    $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp;
    $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp( {binmode => ":raw"} );

Reads file contents into a scalar.  Takes an optional hash reference may be
used to pass options.  The only option is C<binmode>, which is passed to
C<binmode()> on the handle used for reading.

=head2 slurp_utf8

    $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp_utf8;

This is like C<slurp> with a C<binmode> of C<:encoding(UTF-8)>.

=head2 spew

    path("foo.txt")->spew(@data);
    path("foo.txt")->spew({binmode => ":raw"}, @data);

Writes data to a file atomically.  The file is written to a temporary file in
the same directory, then renamed over the original.  An optional hash reference
may be used to pass options.  The only option is C<binmode>, which is passed to
C<binmode()> on the handle used for writing.

=head2 spew_utf8

    path("foo.txt")->spew_utf8(@data);

This is like C<spew> with a C<binmode> of C<:encoding(UTF-8)>.

=head2 stat

    $stat = path("foo.txt")->stat;

Like calling C<stat> from L<File::stat>.

=head2 stringify

    $path = path("foo.txt");
    say $path->stringify; # same as "$path"

Returns a string representation of the path.

=head2 touch

    path("foo.txt")->touch;

Like the Unix C<touch> utility.  Creates the file if it doesn't exist, or else
changes the modification and access times to the current time.

=head2 volume

    $vol = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->volume;

Returns the volume portion of the path.  This is equivalent
equivalent to what L<File::Spec> would give from C<splitpath> and thus
usually is the empty string on Unix-like operating systems.

=head1 BENCHMARKING

I benchmarked a naive file-finding task: finding all C<*.pm> files in C<@INC>.
I tested L<Path::Iterator::Rule> and different subclasses of it that do file
manipulations using file path helpers L<Path::Class>, L<IO::All>, L<File::Fu>
and C<Path::Tiny>.

    Path::Iterator::Rule    0.474s (no objects)
    Path::Tiny::Rule        0.938s (not on CPAN)
    IO::All::Rule           1.355s
    File::Fu::Rule          1.437s (not on CPAN)
    Path::Class::Rule       4.673s

This benchmark heavily stressed object creation and determination of
a file's basename.
